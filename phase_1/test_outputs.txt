The Roman Empire reached its peak in the 2nd century AD, covering vast territories in Europe, Africa, and Asia. The city of Rome was a bustling metropolis with a population of over one million people. It was also the center of Christianity, with the Vatican City located within its borders.

Over the centuries, Rome faced invasions, wars, and political turmoil. The Roman Empire eventually fell in the 5th century AD due to a combination of internal conflict, economic troubles, and external invasions. After the fall of the empire, Rome went through periods of decline and revival.

In the Middle Ages, Rome was ruled by various popes and was a center of religious power in Europe. The Renaissance period brought a renewed interest in art, architecture, and culture to the city. During the 19th century, Rome became the capital of a unified Italy.

Today, Rome is a thriving modern city that still bears witness to its ancient past. Visitors can explore iconic landmarks such as the Colosseum, the Roman Forum, the Pantheon, and the Vatican City.
